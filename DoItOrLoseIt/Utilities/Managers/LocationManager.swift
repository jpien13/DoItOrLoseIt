// Managers are often used to encapsulate logic that doesn't fit
// neatly into the MVVM pattern (Model-View-ViewModel) but is
// still essential for the app's functionality.
//
// Managers are classes or objects designed to handle specific
// tasks related to data management within your application,
// like fetching data from an API, storing user settings,
// or managing complex state across different views, often
// utilizing the concept of "ObservableObject" to update the
// UI whenever data changes within the manager.
